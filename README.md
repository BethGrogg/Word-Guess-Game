# Word-Guess-Game

This is a word game, similar to "Hangman".  The object of the game is to guess the hidden word.  The user sees _ for each letter in the word.  The user guesses letters, and when a correct letter is guessed, it replaces the _ in the word.  The user needs to guess the word with less than 9 incorrect guesses to win.

The theme of this game is Harry Potter.  All of the hidden words are Harry Potter related words.  The Harry Potter theme song plays in the background.  There are 2 messages that play during the game--one for when the user wins and one for when they user loses.  These are both quotes from the Harry Potter movies.
